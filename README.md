INFO ABOUT THIS:

    At Code Nation when we covered Node.js, we learnt about API's and our class challenge was to individually make a website which used 3x API's on it.

    One of the webpages I made was a train departures board for the main railway station here in Manchester, 'Piccadilly Station'.

    For this update project, I have isolated the particular Trains code and will expand it, so it will also show train arrivals.

    Also planned is to restyle the webpage, as the original formatting will not work for the Arrivals section I want to add.
